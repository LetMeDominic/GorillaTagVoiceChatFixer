# GorillaTagVoiceChatFixer

**Gorilla Tag Voice Chat Fixer**
Experiencing the PC bug where voice chat doesn't work in-game? 
This mod should temporarily fix the bug until it's fixed in ComputerInterface.
(NOTE: This mod will force voice chat on and turn off push to talk. Don't install it if you don't want that to happen)

To install this mod, extract the .ZIP directly into your game folder.

Not sure where your game's folder is? Open up Monke Mod Manager, go to the utilities tab, then click `Game Folder`
